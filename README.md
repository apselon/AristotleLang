# Aristotle Programming Language
The first programming language for philosophers, inspired by Plato's concept of forms and ideas.

## Architecture
The source code is tokenized, then an abstract syntax tree is built using a recursive descent algorithm.

Then AST is compiled into X86_64 binary code or into x86_64 ASM.

## Code example
```
obviously, Theurgy _start indeed, hence. 
	definetly, Idea Plato Idea Aristotle
		Let Plato 5
		Let Aristotle Ritual fact indeed, Plato overall.
		Write Aristotle 
		Thanks
	overall.

	Theurgy fact obviously, Dichotomy overall. also,
		Idea Socrates 
		Criterion Dichotomy more 1 indeed,
			Let Socrates Ritual fact obviously, Dichotomy without 1 nevertheless.
			Let Socrates Dichotomy times Socrates 
			Catharsis Socrates 
		hence. also,
			Catharsis 1 
		nevertheless.
	overall.
hence.

```
